# bookbot

The (new) goal of this project is to be a command-line utility for downloading specific public domain ebooks from the Project Gutenberg library, while following their access rules for robots.

It can download the latest catalog (updated once per week), search for books given a list of keywords, and download books based on those results.
Currently it is hardcoded to grab EN/.TXT Frankenstein books for testing purpose.
